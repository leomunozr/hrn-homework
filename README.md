This homework aims to show how I replicate an existing website starting from scratch. 
I used:

- **Gulp**: Automating tasks.
  - gulp-sasss For compiling Sass into CSS.
  - gulp-clean-css: For minifying CSS.
  - gulp-concat: For merging all compiled Sass files into just one file.

  - browser-sync: For making the browser auto refresh each time a css file changes.
- **NPM**: Dependency manager.
- **Git**: Version control.
